# GO Web Clone

Copy websites to your computer! Goclone is a utility that allows you to download a website from the Internet to a local directory. Get html, css, js, images, and other files from the server to your computer. Goclone arranges the original site's relative link-structure. Simply open a page of the "mirrored" website in your browser, and you can browse the site from link to link as if you were viewing it online.
